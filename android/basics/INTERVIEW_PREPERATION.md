## Architecture components

Android Architecture Components are a collection of libraries and guidelines introduced by Google to help developers build robust, testable, and maintainable apps. These components provide a set of APIs and best practices for creating Android apps with a modular approach, allowing developers to focus on their app's logic instead of managing the underlying complexity.

The Architecture Components include:

1. LiveData - LiveData is an observable data holder class that can be used to listen for changes in data, allowing UI components to update automatically when the data changes. LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning that it only updates the UI when the relevant lifecycle state is active.

2. ViewModel - ViewModel is a class that stores UI-related data that survives configuration changes. It allows UI components to communicate with the backend of the app and retrieve the necessary data for the UI without the need to make frequent calls to the backend.

3. Room - Room is a database library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier to work with databases in Android. Room allows developers to work with plain old Java objects (POJOs) instead of writing raw SQL queries.

4. Data Binding - Data Binding is a library that allows developers to bind UI components in their layout files to app data sources. This helps to reduce boilerplate code and improve the readability of the codebase.

5. WorkManager - WorkManager is a library that provides a flexible, reliable, and battery-friendly way to schedule background tasks in Android. It takes care of things like power management, network constraints, and API compatibility, so developers can focus on the task at hand.

6. Navigation - Navigation is a library that simplifies the process of navigating between different screens in an app. It provides a visual editor that allows developers to create a navigation graph that defines the relationships between different screens in the app.

Overall, the Architecture Components provide a set of tools and best practices that can help developers build high-quality Android apps with less boilerplate code and fewer bugs. By using these components, developers can focus on writing clean, concise, and testable code, which leads to more efficient and maintainable apps.

## Jetpack

Jetpack is a suite of libraries, tools, and guidance from Google to help developers write high-quality Android apps more easily and efficiently. Jetpack provides a set of libraries that are designed to work together, follow best practices, and make development tasks easier, faster, and more efficient.

Jetpack is divided into four main categories:

1. Architecture: This category includes libraries for building robust, scalable, and maintainable apps, such as ViewModel, LiveData, Room, and Navigation.

2. Foundation: This category includes core system functionality, such as AppCompat, Android KTX, and Multidex, that make it easier to develop and deploy Android apps.

3. UI: This category includes libraries for building modern and engaging user interfaces, such as RecyclerView, ViewPager2, and Fragment.

4. Behavior: This category includes libraries for handling common app behavior, such as WorkManager, CameraX, and Biometric.

Jetpack libraries are backward-compatible, meaning that they work with older versions of Android and are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Android code. By using Jetpack, developers can focus on writing their app's unique functionality, while Jetpack handles the heavy lifting of managing Android app development.

### What is Multidex?

In Android development, Dalvik Executable (DEX) format is used to transform compiled code into an Android-compatible format. This DEX file format has a limitation that only 65,536 methods can be referenced within a single DEX file. If you try to build an application with more than 65,536 methods, you will encounter a build error: “trouble writing output: Too many field references: 131000; max is 65536.” 

Multidex is a feature that enables an Android application to have multiple DEX files, each containing a specific number of methods, in order to work around the 65,536 method limit. It allows the application to have as many DEX files as required to fit all of the classes needed for the app. 

Multidex support was added to Android as a part of Android Build Tools version 21.1.0, and it is included in the Android Support Library from version 1.0.0 onwards. Multidex can be enabled in the application’s build.gradle file by adding the following lines:

```
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'
}
```

When the multidexEnabled flag is set to true, the Dalvik bytecode build tool creates multiple DEX files for the application, which are then merged together at runtime to create the final DEX file. The multidex support library provides a class called MultiDexApplication, which should be used as the base class for the application class if the application is using multidex.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development that allows components to be more modular, reusable, and easier to test. In this pattern, the dependencies required by a component are injected into the component by an external entity, instead of the component itself creating those dependencies.

In simpler terms, DI is a process of providing objects that a class needs to function, rather than the class creating those objects on its own. This is achieved by creating an external "container" or "framework" that manages the creation and injection of dependencies, so that the component doesn't have to worry about it.

By using DI, components can be easily swapped out and replaced with other implementations, making the application more modular and flexible. Additionally, it makes unit testing easier, as dependencies can be easily mocked or substituted during testing.

DI can be implemented in different ways, such as constructor injection, setter injection, and interface injection. Popular DI frameworks in the Android world include Dagger and Koin.

# Android Components

Main components of Android:

1. Activities: Activities are the entry points for the user interface of an Android app. They represent a single screen with a user interface, and can be used to interact with the user, launch other activities, or start services.

2. Services: Services are components that run in the background without any user interface. They are typically used to perform long-running tasks, such as downloading files, playing music, or monitoring sensors.

3. Broadcast receivers: Broadcast receivers are components that respond to system-wide broadcast announcements, such as when the battery is low or when a new SMS message arrives. They allow apps to receive and process these announcements even when they are not running.

4. Content providers: Content providers are components that manage access to a shared set of app data, such as a database or a file system. They allow different apps to share and manipulate data in a secure and controlled manner.

5. Intents: Intents are objects that represent a request to perform a specific action, such as opening a new activity, starting a service, or sending a broadcast. They can be used to communicate between different components of an app or between different apps.

6. Fragments: Fragments are components that represent a portion of an activity's user interface. They can be used to create reusable user interface components, or to provide different layouts for different screen sizes and orientations.

7. Views: Views are the basic building blocks of an Android user interface. They represent different types of user interface elements, such as buttons, text fields, and images.

These components can be combined in various ways to create complex and sophisticated Android apps.

## Activities

Activities are one of the fundamental building blocks of Android applications. An activity represents a single screen with a user interface, and it is responsible for handling user interactions, displaying information, and managing the application's lifecycle. 

Each activity is implemented as a subclass of the Activity class and has its own lifecycle, which can be managed through a set of lifecycle callbacks that are triggered by the system when certain events occur. These callbacks include methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), among others.

The onCreate() method is called when the activity is first created, and it is where you typically set up the user interface and other initializations. The onStart() method is called when the activity becomes visible to the user, while onResume() is called when the activity is brought to the foreground and becomes the focus of user interaction. onPause() is called when the activity loses focus and is partially visible, while onStop() is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. Finally, onDestroy() is called when the activity is being destroyed and removed from memory.

Activities can also communicate with each other through a variety of mechanisms, including explicit intents, which allow you to start another activity with a specific action and data; implicit intents, which allow you to start an activity without specifying the exact activity to start; and the use of startActivityForResult() to start an activity and receive a result from it.

Overall, activities provide a powerful mechanism for managing the user interface and lifecycle of an Android application, and they are a key component of the Android platform.

The Activity lifecycle in Android consists of several callback methods that are called by the operating system at various points in the activity's lifecycle. These methods allow an application to manage its resources and state as it transitions through different states.

Here is the sequence of the Activity lifecycle methods:

1. `onCreate()`: This method is called when the activity is first created. It is typically used to initialize variables, create views, and perform other setup tasks.

2. `onStart()`: This method is called when the activity is about to become visible to the user. It is typically used to register receivers for system events and to perform other tasks that need to be done when the activity is in the foreground.

3. `onResume()`: This method is called when the activity is about to start interacting with the user. It is typically used to start animations, play music, and to perform other tasks that require user interaction.

4. `onPause()`: This method is called when the activity is about to lose focus. It is typically used to save the state of the activity, stop animations, and to release resources that are not needed when the activity is not in the foreground.

5. `onStop()`: This method is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. It is typically used to release resources that are no longer needed.

6. `onDestroy()`: This method is called when the activity is about to be destroyed. It is typically used to release resources that are no longer needed and to unregister receivers for system events.

7. `onRestart()`: This method is called when the activity is being restarted after being stopped. It is typically used to re-initialize variables and other resources that need to be reset when the activity is restarted.

Note that some of these methods may not be called in certain situations, depending on how the activity is being used. For example, if the activity is being destroyed due to a configuration change (such as a screen rotation), `onDestroy()` will not be called, but `onPause()` and `onResume()` will be called.

## Services

In Android, a Service is an application component that performs long-running operations in the background without a user interface. A Service runs in the background and can perform tasks even when the user is not interacting with the app. Services can be used for various purposes, such as playing music in the background, downloading data, or performing network operations.

There are two types of Services in Android:

1. Started Services: These services are started when an application component, such as an Activity, sends a request to start the service using startService() method. The service continues to run in the background even if the component that started it is destroyed.

2. Bound Services: These services are bound to an application component using bindService() method. Bound services provide a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service. When all clients unbind from the service, the service is destroyed.

The lifecycle of a Service is as follows:

1. onCreate() – This method is called when the service is created. It is used to initialize resources such as threads and listeners.

2. onStartCommand() – This method is called when startService() method is called. It is used to start the service and perform the desired operation.

3. onBind() – This method is called when bindService() method is called. It is used to establish communication between the Service and the client.

4. onUnbind() – This method is called when all clients unbind from the Service. It is used to clean up any resources used by the Service.

5. onDestroy() – This method is called when the Service is destroyed. It is used to release any resources used by the Service.

Services can also run in different processes by specifying android:process attribute in the Service declaration in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Running Services in different processes can provide better performance and stability for the application.

Services do not have a UI by default. Services are designed to perform long-running operations in the background without interfering with the user interface. However, it is possible to create a service with a UI by using the System Alert Window feature, which allows a service to display a UI element on top of all other apps. This is commonly used for things like chat heads or other floating widgets. But in general, services are meant to be run in the background without any user interaction.

To create a service in Android, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new class that extends the `Service` class.
2. Override the `onCreate()` method, which is called when the service is created.
3. Define the service's behavior by implementing the `onStartCommand()` method. This method is called every time the service is started.
4. Implement the `onDestroy()` method to handle cleanup when the service is destroyed.
5. Optionally, you can also define an interface for communication between the service and other components in your app.

Here's an example of how to create a basic service in Android:

```kotlin
class MyService : Service() {
    override fun onBind(intent: Intent): IBinder? {
        // Implement your service logic here
        return null
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyService` extends the `Service` class, which is a built-in class in Android that represents a long-running operation in the background. The `onBind` method is called when another component, such as an activity, binds to the service. Here, you would implement the logic for your service, such as performing a network request or playing audio in the background.
